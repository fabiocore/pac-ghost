# Pac-Ghost Implementation with Amazon Q

This document outlines the implementation of Pac-Ghost, a battle-royale style maze game inspired by Pac-Man, created with the assistance of Amazon Q.

## Project Overview

Pac-Ghost is a PyGame-based game where the player controls a blue ghost competing against nine AI-controlled ghosts in a procedurally generated maze. The goal is to be the last ghost standing by consuming PacMan characters to level up and eliminate other ghosts.

## Implementation Details

The game was implemented with a modular structure:

1. **Main Game Loop**: Handles the core game loop, event processing, and state management.

2. **Maze Generation**: Creates procedural mazes with warp tunnels and ensures at least 60% walkable area.

3. **Entity System**: 
   - Ghost class for player and AI ghosts
   - PacMan class for collectible power-ups
   - Level and speed progression mechanics

4. **AI Implementation**:
   - A* pathfinding for intelligent ghost movement
   - Decision making based on visibility and target prioritization
   - Random movement when no targets are in sight

5. **Collision System**:
   - Ghost-PacMan collisions for leveling up
   - Ghost-Ghost collisions with level-based elimination rules

6. **UI System**:
   - Menu screens
   - HUD with player information
   - PacMan spawn timer display
   - Game over and spectator modes

## Key Features

- **Procedural Maze Generation**: Every game has a unique maze layout
- **Level-Based Mechanics**: Higher level ghosts can eliminate lower level ones
- **AI Behavior**: AI ghosts hunt PacMan or weaker ghosts based on visibility
- **Classic Arcade Style**: Retro graphics and sound inspired by the original Pac-Man

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for the game:

1. Add more sophisticated AI behaviors
2. Implement power-ups beyond just PacMan characters
3. Add difficulty levels
4. Create more varied maze generation algorithms
5. Add sound effects and music
6. Implement a high score system
